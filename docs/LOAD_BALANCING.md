# Load Balancing & Backend Selection

The proxy selects backends through a three-stage pipeline on every request: filter by path → order by load-balance mode → gate by circuit breaker.

> **TL;DR**
> - **Specific-path hosts always win** — if any configured host matches the request path, catch-all hosts are never tried.
> - **`LoadBalanceMode`** controls host order (round-robin / latency / random); **`IterationMode`** controls how many attempts are made.
> - **A `429` with `S7PREQUEUE`** requeues the request; any other non-2xx advances to the next host; TTL expiry stops iteration with `412`.

```

**The circuit-breaker gate means an OPEN host is never attempted, so `MaxAttempts` counts only hosts actually tried.**

---

## Selecting a Backend

**Rule: The path filter runs first; within the matched set, `LoadBalanceMode` determines which host is tried first.**

```bash
LoadBalanceMode=latency   # try fastest host first
# Hosts sorted by average response time, lowest first
```

| Mode | Best for |
|------|----------|
| `roundrobin` | Homogeneous backends; fair distribution |
| `latency` | Backends with measurably different response times |
| `random` | Avoiding predictable traffic patterns |

> [!NOTE]
> **Default:** `LoadBalanceMode=random`. Path prefix is stripped before forwarding unless `stripprefix=false` is set on the host (see [BACKEND_HOSTS.md](BACKEND_HOSTS.md#controlling-path-prefix-stripping)).

> [!TIP]
> **Troubleshooting:** If a specific host is never reached, verify its configured path prefix matches the inbound request path; a mismatch silently excludes it from the candidate set.

---

## Retrying Across Backends

**Rule: `SinglePass` tries each host once; `MultiPass` cycles through all hosts up to `MaxAttempts` total.**

```bash
IterationMode=MultiPass
MaxAttempts=7
# 3 hosts → up to 2 full passes + 1 extra attempt
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Default:** `IterationMode=SinglePass`. `MaxAttempts` is ignored in SinglePass mode.

> [!TIP]
> **Troubleshooting:** Seeing more failures than expected? A low `MaxAttempts` combined with many OPEN circuits can exhaust the attempt budget before a healthy host is reached — check circuit-breaker state with `LogHeaders=true`.

### Shared Iterators

Set `UseSharedIterators=true` when many concurrent requests target the same path and you need strict round-robin fairness across them. Each path then maintains a single shared counter instead of per-request counters.

---

## Handling Responses

**Rule: Only `2xx` returns to the client; everything else either retries, requeues, or stops.**

| Response | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `2xx` | Return to client |
| `3xx`, `404`, `5xx` | Try next host |
| `429` + `S7PREQUEUE` header | Collect; try next host. If **all** hosts return this, requeue with shortest `retry-after`. |
| `412` Precondition Failed | TTL expired — stop, no further retries |
| All hosts exhausted (non-429) | `503 Service Unavailable` |

> [!WARNING]
> **Error:** `412` means the request's TTL expired during iteration. Increase `DefaultTTLSecs` or reduce backend latency — adding more `MaxAttempts` will not help once TTL is gone.

---

## Worked Example

> **Setup:** 3 hosts (`A avg 200 ms`, `B avg 80 ms`, `C avg 150 ms`), `LoadBalanceMode=latency`, `IterationMode=MultiPass`, `MaxAttempts=5`.

| Attempt | Host tried (latency order) | Response | Action |
|---------|---------------------------|----------|--------|
| 1 | B (80 ms — fastest) | 503 | try next |
| 2 | C (150 ms) | circuit OPEN | skip (no attempt counted) |
| 3 | A (200 ms) | 503 | try next |
| 4 | B (second pass) | 200 | **return to client** |

**Attempts used: 4 of 5. Host C's open circuit was skipped without spending an attempt budget entry.**

## Monitoring & Diagnostics

Enable header logging to trace backend selection:

```bash
LogHeaders=true
```

Key response headers to inspect:

| Header | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `Backend-Host` | Host that ultimately served the request |
| `BackendAttempts` | Number of hosts tried |
| `Total-Latency` | End-to-end request duration |
