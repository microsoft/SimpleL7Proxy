# Request Validation

SimpleL7Proxy can validate incoming requests against user profiles, allowing you to:
- **Control access** to proxy features on a per-user basis
- **Apply custom priority levels** based on user identity  
- **Enable async processing** only for authorized users
- **Add user-specific headers** automatically

See the **[User Profiles Guide](USER_PROFILES.md)** for complete configuration details and examples.
