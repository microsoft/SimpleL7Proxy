
Summary for ProxyWorker.cs
- The ProxyWorker.cs file is part of a proxy service built using .NET 9. This file handles incoming requests, processes them, and sends responses back to the clients. The proxy service supports concurrent processing of approximately 1000 tasks under normal workloads.

Key functionalities include:

- Event Data Logging: The file logs various details about the incoming requests and their processing status. This includes information such as the request path, method, headers, and processing durations.
- Header Management: The file manages and updates request headers to include additional information such as queue duration, process duration, worker ID, and priority.
- State Management: The file uses Interlocked operations to manage the state of the worker, ensuring thread-safe increments and decrements of state counters.
- Asynchronous Processing: The file uses asynchronous methods (ReadProxyAsync) to handle the proxying of requests, allowing for efficient handling of multiple concurrent tasks.
- Conditional Logging: The file conditionally logs headers based on the configuration options provided (_options.LogHeaders).

The file ensures that each request is processed efficiently and logs relevant information for monitoring and debugging purposes.

## Coding Standard for the Project

1. **Naming Conventions:**
   - Use PascalCase for class names, method names, and properties.
   - Use camelCase for local variables and method parameters.
   - Prefix private fields with an underscore (`_`).

2. **Braces and Indentation:**
   - Use K&R style braces (opening brace on the same line as the statement).
   - Indent using 4 spaces.

3. **Spacing:**
   - Use a single space before and after operators.
   - Use a single space after commas in parameter lists.
   - Use a single blank line to separate methods.

4. **Comments:**
   - Use XML comments for public methods and classes.
   - Use inline comments sparingly and only when the code is not self-explanatory.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Use exceptions for error handling.
   - Avoid using exceptions for control flow.

6. **Logging:**
   - Log relevant information using the telemetry client.
   - Ensure logs include timestamps.

7. **Async Programming:**
   - Use asynchronous programming practices where applicable.
   - Use `async` and `await` keywords for asynchronous methods.
