==========================================
 NULL SERVER:

To run the null/mock server in a new terminal:
  1) Open a new terminal window
  2) Change directory to the nullserver project: {{PY_DIR_OR_DOTNET}}
  3) Start the null server on port {{PORT}}:
     {{START_CMD}}

Notes:
- The nullserver can run in either python3 or dotnet.
- The python code is located in  test/nullserver/Python.
- The dotnet code is located in test/nullserver/dotnet.
- The .NET nullserver reads 'port' from appsettings.json; using --urls overrides the listening address.
