To run the proxy using the generated env file in your current shell:
  1) Source the env file to export variables:
       source {{LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE}}
  2) Start the proxy from the SimpleL7Proxy project root:
       cd src/SimpleL7Proxy && dotnet run

These steps assume you've sourced the environment file in the same shell so child processes see the exported variables.
